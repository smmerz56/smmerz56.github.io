      elements that indicate type of content. span is a special case in that it doesn't really say, 
      hey this is a different sort of text section than other sections of the page. Instead span is used 
      to mark of specific phrases within a larger text section. All this is to say, you should nest 
      this span tag within a div or p element.-->

  <div class="firstP">Washington, constituent state of the United States of America. Lying at the
    northwestern corner of the 48 conterminous states, it is bounded by the Canadian province of British Columbia to the
    north, the U.S. states of Idaho to the east and Oregon to the south, and the Pacific Ocean to the west. The capital
    is Olympia, located at the southern end of Puget Sound in the western part of the state. The state’s coastal
    location and excellent harbours give it a leading role in trade with Alaska, Canada, and countries of the Pacific
    Rim. Washington cities have sister cities in several countries, and their professional and trade associations
    commonly include Canadian members.

    <!--Mark's Comment: the colspan attribute tells the browser that this one column spans across a number of cells, in this case 500, which means your table is 500 columns wide. I'm guessing that wasn't intentional. In your other rows, you have 2 columns so this colspan value should be 2-->
    <th colspan="500">
      Plant Community Zones that can be found:
    </th>
    <tr>
      <td>Forest Zone</td>
      <td>58% of Mount Rainier park is covered by forest. The Low elevation forests are distributed from the park's
        boundary from 1,700 feet to 2,700 feet elevation and are dominated by western hemlock, Douglas-fir, and western
        red cedar. As for Mid-elevation forests extend from 2,700 feet upward to 4,000 to 6,000 feet. For high elevation
        forests, they are characterized by subalpine fir, mountain hemlock, and Alaskan yellow cedar. Forest ages range
        from young stands (less than 100 years old) to old growth stands 1,000 or more years old.
      </td>

    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Subapline Zone</td>
      <td>In the high elevation forests, trees become less dense as the forest transitions into subalpine parkland. The
        subalpine parkland covers approximately 23 percent of the park. Vegetation in this zone is a mosaic of tree
        clumps and herbaceous meadows extending from forest line to tree line, or about 5,000 feet to about 7,000 feet
        elevation. Tree cover and the location of plant communities in this zone is limited by the depth and duration of
        the snowpack.
      </td>

    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Alpine Zone </td>
      <td>The alpine zone extends from treelined to the mountain's summit. Permanent snow and ice cover about 50 percent
        of the zone. Whereas, Alpine vegetation covers the remainder, divided into four broad vegetation types. The type
        and location of vegetation in the alpine zone is controlled by length of the growing season, slope, and aspect.
